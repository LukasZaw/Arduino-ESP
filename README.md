### 1. [Dallas Web Server](projects/dallas_websever)
- **Description:** This project is a web-based temperature monitoring system using an ESP8266 and a DS18B20 temperature sensor. The temperature data is updated dynamically using AJAX requests.
- **Features:**
  - Reads temperature data from a DS18B20 sensor.
  - Hosts a web server on ESP8266/ESP32 to display real-time temperature readings.
  - Uses AJAX to update temperature values without refreshing the page.
  - Displays data in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
  - Connects to Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.
